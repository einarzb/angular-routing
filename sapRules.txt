configure services before they're actually created
every service has a provider ($http or $state)
this func runs first! 

the providers come with the ui.router lib

state - by changing state on an app we can change the view. it points to a place in the app (ui wise)
it's name represent what the user sees when they open our application. 
by routing via state instead of the url, we can build more robust and functional applications. 
we can assign a specific URL to each state but it's not necessary.
